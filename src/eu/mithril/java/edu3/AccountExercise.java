 * This program demonstrates working with Account objects by:
 * 1. Creating two Account instances with IDs and initial balances
 * 2. Performing a deposit on one account
 * 3. Performing a withdrawal from another account
 * 4. Printing final balances of both accounts with their IDs and currency
 *
 * Requirements:
 * 1. Create two Account objects with different IDs and initial balances
 * 2. Deposit some money to the first account
 * 3. Withdraw some money from the second account
 * 4. Print the ID and balance (with currency) of both accounts after operations

 * - Format the balance to exactly 2 decimal places
